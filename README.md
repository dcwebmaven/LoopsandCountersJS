# LoopsandCountersJS
This JavaScript project experiments with for and while loops and counters.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

There are two goals for this project: 

First, use a while loop and an if statement to count from 1 to 10 and add the result of each iteration to a text field. When a button is selected the text field should display 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 

Second, use a for loop and an if statement to count from 1 to 10 and add the result of each iteration to a text field. When a button is selected the text field should display 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
